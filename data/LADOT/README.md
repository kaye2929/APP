# About LADOT Data
LADOT data was shared with our team in November 10, 2022 by Elizabeth Winter from the LADOT For-Hire Policy and Enforcement Division. Data contains the following information:
- Origin-Destination Trip count by LA Neighborhood Councils for 2019-2022
- .geojson files for various transporation planning areas
- Vehicle Deployment Average count by LA Neighborhood Councils

Modifications to data since it was first shared:
From EW's email to us on 12/28/2022,
Cell O28 on "2019 Neighborhood Council Trip Matrix" workbook was missing a value. EW informed us that the trip count for cell O28 is 11.
The old version of the workbook was retitled to "2019 Neighborhood Council Trip Matrix - missing data.xlsx"
The new version reflecting EW's 12/28 edit is titled "2019 Neighborhood Council Trip Matrix.xlsx"

We also generated summary stats based on LADOT data before we cleaned the workbooks. These summary stats match with the cleaned data.
