Get_ACS2021_Demos.R is a script that pulls Census Bureau's American Community Survey data for the 2021 5-Year Estimates. 
We obtained ACS data via the Census Bureau API for the following demographics:

The resulting .geojson file contains census tract level data for all the tables above for the County of Los Angeles. The mapping projects files aggregating the tract level data to neighborhood council level demographics.
