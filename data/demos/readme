Get_ACS2021_Demos.R is a script that pulls Census Bureau's American Community Survey data for the 2021 5-Year Estimates. 
We obtained ACS data via the Census Bureau API for the following demographics:
- Total Population (B02001)
- Population by Race (B02001)
- Poverty Levels (S1701)
- 

The resulting .geojson file contains census tract level data for the County of Los Angeles. The mapping projects work on aggregating the tract level data to neighborhood council level.
